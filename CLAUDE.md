# Project Guidelines

This is a learning-focused repository. All code and documentation should:

- Include doc strings explaining what the code does and why
- Use plain language that someone with no prior knowledge can understand
- Be succinct - explain concepts clearly without unnecessary verbosity
- Prioritize teaching over production optimization
