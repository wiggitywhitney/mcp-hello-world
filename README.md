# mcp-hello-world

A learning-focused MCP server that demonstrates how the Model Context Protocol works.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that lets AI assistants like Claude use external tools. Think of it like a plugin system:

1. You build a **server** that offers tools
2. Claude connects to your server
3. Claude can now call your tools during conversations

This project is a minimal example: one server, one tool.

## What Does This Server Do?

It has one tool called `hello`. When Claude calls it, the tool returns `world`.

That's it. The simplicity is intentional - this is about understanding *how* MCP works, not building something complex.

## Project Structure

```
mcp-hello-world/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts      # The MCP server (heavily documented)
├── dist/             # Compiled JavaScript (generated by build)
├── package.json      # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
```

## How to Build

```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm run build  # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
```

## How to Use With Claude

To connect this server to Claude, add it to your MCP configuration.

**For Claude Code (CLI):**

Add to `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hello-world": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp-hello-world/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop App:**

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hello-world": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp-hello-world/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, restart Claude. The `hello` tool will be available.

## How MCP Communication Works

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │  stdin  │                 │
│     Claude      │────────▶│   MCP Server    │
│                 │◀────────│                 │
│                 │ stdout  │                 │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

1. Claude launches the server as a subprocess
2. Claude sends JSON messages to the server via stdin
3. The server processes requests and sends responses via stdout
4. This back-and-forth follows the MCP protocol specification

## Key Concepts

### Server
The main object that manages everything. It:
- Registers available tools
- Handles incoming requests
- Routes tool calls to handler functions

### Tool
A function that Claude can call. Each tool has:
- **Name**: How Claude identifies it (e.g., "hello")
- **Description**: Helps Claude know when to use it
- **Parameters**: What inputs it accepts (our tool has none)
- **Handler**: The code that runs when called

### Transport
How the server communicates. We use `StdioServerTransport` which means:
- Input comes from stdin
- Output goes to stdout
- Claude runs the server as a subprocess

This is the standard approach for local MCP servers.
